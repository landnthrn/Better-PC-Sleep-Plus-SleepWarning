# ForceSleep-Sleep-Warning
For users that just can't figure out what is keeping your PC awake or would just like to have a sleep warning system. 


---

## HOW TO SETUP FORCESLEEP/SLEEPWARNING:  
\**Use all commands provided in Command Prompt Admin*\*

- Go to your Documents folder

- Create a folder called Scripts

- Create another folder inside the Scripts folder called ForceSleep

- Place all the files from this download into there

- Search Windows for Environment Variables

- Once the System Properties tab opens, select Environment Variables again.

- Under the User Variables (top box), select Path, then Edit

- Select New and paste the path of your ForceSleep folder. It should look like:  
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts\ForceSleep`

- (Optional but foolproof to add the Scripts folder path too):  
  `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts`

Recommended to replace the %USERNAME% parts with your PC username,  
so say it was Elephant it would be `C:\Users\Elephant\Documents\Scripts`  

- Click OK a few times to close Environment Variables

- Open Command Prompt as Administrator

- Edit the following command before running it. Replace `%USERNAME%` with your PC username *(there are two to replace)*

**THE COMMAND:**  
```schtasks /create /tn "ForceSleep_Watcher" /tr "powershell.exe -NoProfile -NoLogo -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts\ForceSleep\forcesleep.ps1"" /sc ONLOGON /ru "%USERNAME%" /it /rl LIMITED```

- Once you've created the ForceSleep_Watcher task with that command

- Open Task Scheduler and find the ForceSleep_Watcher task

- Right click it > Properties > Settings > make sure “Stop the task if it runs longer than” is set to 3 days

- Close Task Scheduler

------

## TEST IF IT WORKS:

- Open the ForceSleep.ps1 file (Right click > Edit)

- At the top, change:
`$ThresholdMinutes = 25`
to
`$ThresholdMinutes = 0.5`

- This makes it trigger within about 30 seconds of idle time for testing

- Save changes to the ForceSleep.ps1 file

**Note:** Every time you make a change to these files, you should restart the ForceSleep_Watcher task by using this command:  
`schtasks /end /tn "ForceSleep_Watcher" & timeout /t 2 /nobreak >nul & schtasks /run /tn "ForceSleep_Watcher"`

- Once you've restarted the task, don't touch your mouse or keyboard for 30 seconds. See if the Sleep Warning appears — don’t cancel it so you can confirm it sleeps properly

- After you've verified it works, open ForceSleep.ps1 again and change $ThresholdMinutes = 0.5 to any number of minutes you'd like, then save

- Restart the task again with this command:
`schtasks /end /tn "ForceSleep_Watcher" & timeout /t 2 /nobreak >nul & schtasks /run /tn "ForceSleep_Watcher"`

## INFO:

You can cancel the sleep from happening by pressing Ctrl + C,  
or pause it by clicking inside the terminal pop-up and resume it by pressing any key.

If you have media/audio playing, it will pause it before sleep to prevent audio tasks from thinking something crashed.
